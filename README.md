## Introduction
The notebooks in this repository are for reference and demonstration purposes. 
We provide examples of how to access and analyze data from different EO platforms.
These notebooks are created for use within our own analysis and research. For indepth tutorials and guides we recommend visiting the official documentation of the EO platforms.

## EO Platforms

### [Planetary Computer](Planetary_Computer)
The Planetary Computer is a platform that enables researchers to access and analyze petabytes of geospatial data. 
It provides a cloud-based environment for working with large-scale raster, vector, and tabular data, and includes a growing collection of open datasets and analysis tools.
The folder contains our public notebooks that demonstrate how to use the Planetary Computer to access and analyze data.

For more information on the Planetary Computer, visit the [Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/) website or [documentation](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/overview/about/).

### [Digital Earth Australia (DEA)](DEA)
The Digital Earth Australia (DEA) platform provides an open and freely accessible archive of Earth observation data for Australia.
Coupled with a powerful and scalable computing environment to enable users to perform analysis on a wide range of data sources.

For more information about DEA, visit the [DEA](https://www.ga.gov.au/dea) website or [documentation](https://docs.dea.ga.gov.au/).
